try does not include all code in its scope , so we will have possible uncatched errors
umanaged resources in  --->  
filestream: both read and write actions
streamreader
streamwriter  
we should dispose for all - using ....
in catch there is throw new exceptipn which is bad practice

other: 
reader.ReadToEnd() problamatic in case of a large file 
if target file on create does not exist , it will also fail - check directory exists
